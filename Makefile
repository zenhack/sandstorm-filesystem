# App is declared as PHONY because (1) go build manages most of the dependency
# tracking, and (2) it's a pain to get make to find all of the deps, so
# sometimes it doesn't rebuild when it should.
#
# The downside is we sometimes end up re-building app.debug and app.stripped
# when we don't need to.
